# DESIGN A MULTI-CLASS PROGRAM

----

## Objective

To learn how to design a multi-class program by using the idea of **Design Recipes** which involves describing the problem through *user stories*, designing the class interface(i.e. name of class, initializer, parameters), and create examples as tests and implement the behaviour according to the examples cycle(`red` `green` `refactor` cycle).

----

**In object-oriented programming, the most important unit of behaviour is the Class.** Programs are built by creating classes that work together to accomplish the job of the program.
To learn and understand this, I am going to:

[x] Test drive a single-class program.

[x] Design a single-class program.

[x] Test drive a system of classes.

[x] **Design a system of classes.**
